## Updating Docs
To make it very easy to main the docs, only very specific problems are given a full description. Whereas a lot of the documentation should consist of hyperlinks.

### Testing HyperLinks


## How to maintain the compendium
For information that only needs to be updated once and information that you are confident/ very sure will not be updated

## JavaScript Documentation layout
Difficulty and Complexity of API will determine how in-depth the documentation written for each API section will be for instance. Thus are grouped accordingly
- Simple API
- Complex API
- Special API
- Other Docs

### Simple API
These API has one main specific use case, such as Babel - transpiling ES6+ standards to ES5, thus it will only consists of less documentation.

Why?
- Even though, there is a lot of configurability, it is usually recommended that individuals/teams choose the recommend Babel presets availables. Rather than create one entirely from scratch, i.e. just "env" presets available or those written by large companies 

#### Checklist
- Setup Documentation are easily navigable
- API design is pretty easy to follow, such as Cypress

### Complex API
Are ones that are badly documented such as D3, considered one of the hardest APIs to navigate and 

#### Checklist
- Very Large Libraries - React 
- Poor Documentation - where new users find it fairly difficult to navigate and confused on where they should start
- Highly Configurable - libraries such as Webpack are specialised to allow for advanced features such as lazy loading and code spliting

### Special API
These are ones that derive core functionality, a sort of meta-tooling

#### Checklist
- Core Functionality

### Other Docs
These are documents that exists inside the scope of the JavaScript ecosystem, however are not part of the previous 3 groups mentioned above.
