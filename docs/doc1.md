## Motivation
With the current JavaScript scene and web evolving at an unprecedented rate - with some major release updates made every 6 month cycle, it's becomes ever so difficult to stay up-to-date with the latest releases of JavaScript tool out there or new updates to node. Making the task of being in "now" pretty daunting, leading to what folks in the industry call ["JavaScript Fatigue"](https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4).

However this is somewhat a good problem, a rich ecosystem of tools that are constantly updated keeps the JavaScript environment more secure and better improvements are made to these tools every month. The difficulty here is tracking changes and filtering all that information that is worth sharing with the team, that would be useful for:

- Encouraging tech adoption amongst team members
- Applying Pareto rule and see whether it fits with the current tech stack of the team

Thus the purposed idea of a complying the compendium, for these main reasons:
- Personal Use
  - Release Timetable - when the major release dates will be and when
  - Tool Maturity - when it has been released - this is somewhat an important indicator, and we can apply a concept known as the "Lindy Effect". In short, the longer something stays around, the greater the chance it will stay round for a longer, rather than become obselete.
  - Data Bank of information - filter and keep track of information that is relevant
    - Deprecated parts of the ECMAscript standard
    - Latest feature in the new Version of ECMAScript, with accompanying examples or live example even
    - Cost of using the tool
    - Used by major companies
    - Why use above other tools
  - Quick tooling setup, for tools that have high configurability such as Webpack
  - (Optional)Tool reviews
  - Sources - in this case TC39
  - Who to follow the most recent updates, Twitter handle, repos especially from team member
